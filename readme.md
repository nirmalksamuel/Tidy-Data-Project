###	README  file for  Project done in
###	Course : Getting and Cleaning Data  by  John Hopkins U. 
==================================================================

The data was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung 
Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site 
where the data was obtained: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

For your convienience, I have created a subdirectory in GitHub, 
that contains all the files that came with the original dataset.
The program that creates the tidy dataset, as per project 
specifications, is contained in the file **run_analysis.R**.
If you are unfamiliar with the project, start by reading the
file called README.txt that is in DataSet directory. For
understanding more about the program, please read CodeBook.md



###  The starting (original) dataset includes the following Code Books:
==================================================================

- 'README.txt'
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.:
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- activity_labels.txt: Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. 
Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject 
who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is 
from 1 to 30. 

For further information, please read the CodeBook.md and the
information files contained in the subdirectory DataSet.
